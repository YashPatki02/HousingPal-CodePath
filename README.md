## About

### Description and Purpose

HousingPal is a web application designed to be a one-stop-shop to find sublets/subleases, leases, and roommates aimed at college students. As the name suggests, this platform aims to ease the housing process that college students go through at the beginning of each school year due to diminishing housing options and high costs. We focus primarily on transparency and open communication between parties to streamline the entire process for everyone involved. 
- **Dedicated Housing Platform** - Provide a purposeful medium to help college students secure housing without the reliance on Facebook Groups and other extraneous sources to scurry in search of housing. 
- **Transparency** - Provide transparency to tenants, subtenants, and roommates by displaying costs and preferences up front to help connect interested, compatible parties. 
- **Convenience** - Finding housing is stressful and very time-consuming, so our goal is to ease that process by allowing users to filter through what they are looking for, posting details, and contact each other if there's a match. 

### Inspiration

When speaking with each other, we had several ideas: applications for finding campus events, finding rideshares, syncing playlists between streaming services, and finding people to study within your classes. However, we decided to pursue this idea since both of us struggled due to the lack of housing during COVID-19 and experienced hardships finding roommates and leases using college-specific Facebook Groups, Discord chats, and other sources without much luck or with unnecessary troubles. 

As a result, this idea addresses a tangible issue that many college students face while allowing us to design an application based on what we would have liked to have when we were navigating the Housing process ourselves.
