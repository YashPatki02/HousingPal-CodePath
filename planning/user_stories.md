3. As a student looking for a sublet, I want to filter sublease listings based on preferences such as gender, age, and location to find the most suitable housing options.
4. As a tenant with a lease, I want to post my lease details and indicate my preferences for additional roommates to find compatible roommates to join my lease.
5. As a student looking for a lease, I want to filter lease listings based on the preferences of current tenants, such as gender, age, and location, to find housing that matches my criteria.
6. As a student seeking housing, I want to create a user post with my bio, preferences, hobbies, and budget range so that potential roommates and landlords can learn more about me and reach out.
7. As a tenant or user looking for housing, I want to view detailed listings that include information on the names of tenants, location, cost, lease duration, contact info, and any additional notes.
8. As a tenant or user looking for housing, I want to see a list of students' profiles who are searching for housing and filter them based on criteria like major, age, and budget to find potential roommates.

10. As a tenant or user seeking housing, I want to connect with other users, either to express interest in their listings or to discuss potential housing arrangements.
