## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

In this unit, the planning and organization of the project went well. I designed the database schema, sketched out all the pages that I hope to implement, and created the project board on GitHub. We will also go over Passport.js in class, so I look forward to learning more about authentication and authorization to implement into our project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I decided to work on the project individually as I had been working on most aspects of the project by myself. I believe this will be a challenge in terms of time management and lack of discussion before implementing difficult features, however, it will allow me the freedom to work at my own pace and plan out the project as I see fit. Even though I regret not working with a partner to hone my communication skills, I believe this will be a good learning experience and will challenge me to work harder and practice other skills such as time management and planning.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

I finished almost all the tasks in our sprint plan for this week. I had planned to have a basic frontend done for the project, but I was not able to create a layout complete with headings, text, and forms for each of the pages. I did complete most of the backend, but I noticed some changes that I will have to make to the database and the way I am storing my tables. I want to prioritize setting up the basic frontend to begin testing if the queries are working properly and test all the CRUD operations.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, I believe that the User Profiles might be "at risk" because I will be learning about authorization this week and I am not sure how I want to handle Users creating Profiles in this project yet. I will implement the basic feature of Login/Register and then work on making it a nicer experience for the user if I have time.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Since I am working alone, I may need additional help with discussing and validating my ideas with someone. I will also need some help on the backend to verify that I have set up the database correctly and that my queries are working properly. Although I believe I will able to complete the assigment on my own, I realize that I will need some help to make sure I am on the right track and that I am not missing anything important.
