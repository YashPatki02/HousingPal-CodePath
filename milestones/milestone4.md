## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I was able to work on the Frontend Routes and make progress on the database, controllers, and services. Although I am not done with the backend, I am making progress and I am confident that I will be able to finish it soon and move on to the frontend.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I was following the steps from the labs and there were a lot of parts where my code simply wasn't working. Debugging was difficult as I had so many different files to look at and different configurations to follow. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

I did not finish all of my tasks. I would prioritize the remaining tasks by finishing the backend first and then moving on to the frontend.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I would consider the frontend to be at risk along with some features like the favorites page and possibly the filtering of posts. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I am most definitely going to need more help with debugging if I continue to face the same issues I did this unit.
