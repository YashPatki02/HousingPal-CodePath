## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Time and task management worked well during this unit, as we were able to complete the tasks we set out to do. We were able to discuss our plans and divide up tasks based on our preferences and skills. We 
realized the scope of our project might be too large, but we decided to write down all the features we wanted to implement and focus on the core, required features first and then move on to the additional features if we have time. We also put down our ideas for the database and wireframes, which helped us visualize the app and plan out the backend architecture.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had planned to meet up some time during the week to discuss our progress, but we were not able to do so due to our personal schedules and school work. However, we ensured that we were in contact over
text and kept each other accountable for the tasks needed to be completed. There were also some issues 
when designing the ERD, but the CodePath resources and other online sources enabled us to create 
the ERD and plan out the database.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

After the pitch, we are hoping to narrow down the scope of our project in order to have a project
that is feasible and realistic within the given timeframe. We also may need to reach out to TFs
for help in navigating the various features that we hope to implement. Finally, we need to figure out 
how to work on the codebase at the same time and discuss the git workflow to ensure that we are both
on the same page throughout the project.
